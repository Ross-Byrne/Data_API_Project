# Data Representation and Querying Project 2015
### Ross Byrne
A third year Data Representation and Querying Project 2015. A project to design a simple API for a dataset.

## Introduction
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "Parks in Galway City" which is available at [data.gov.ie](http://data.gov.ie)

## About The Parks In Galway City Dataset
The dataset comes in the form of a .CSV file which I have converted  into JSON, making it easier to work with.
The dataset has 14 columns with the following headings:
